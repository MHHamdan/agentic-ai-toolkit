"""
Incident Rate Tracking Module

Tracks safety-relevant events during agent operation for evaluation
and compliance reporting. Essential for long-horizon evaluation where
safety incidents can compound over time.

Incident types tracked:
- Human intervention requests
- Guardrail/safety filter activations
- Policy and constraint violations
- Unexpected terminations
- Tool failures
- Timeouts
- Resource exhaustion

Example:
    >>> from agentic_toolkit.evaluation.incident_tracker import (
    ...     IncidentTracker, IncidentType, IncidentSeverity
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> tracker = IncidentTracker()
    >>>
    >>> # Record incidents as they occur
    >>> tracker.record_incident(
    ...     incident_type=IncidentType.GUARDRAIL_ACTIVATION,
    ...     severity=IncidentSeverity.MEDIUM,
    ...     description="Blocked attempt to access /etc/passwd",
    ...     context={"task_id": "task_123", "tool": "file_read"}
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> # Get statistics
    >>> stats = tracker.get_statistics(window_hours=24)
    >>> print(f"Incident rate: {stats.incident_rate_per_hour:.2f}/hour")
