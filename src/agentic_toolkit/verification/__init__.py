"""Verification module for plan validation and guarded execution.

Provides:
- ConstraintChecker: Pre/post condition verification
- PlanSimulator: Dry-run tool execution
- PlanValidator: Comprehensive plan validation
- GuardedExecutor: Policy-enforced execution
- Policy DSL: Policy-as-code definitions

Usage:
    >>> from agentic_toolkit.verification import GuardedExecutor, Policy
    >>> from agentic_toolkit.planning import Plan
    >>>
    >>> policy = Policy.from_yaml("security_policy.yaml")
    >>> executor = GuardedExecutor(policy)
    >>>
    >>> result = executor.execute(plan, tools)
    >>> if result.blocked:
    ...     print(f"Blocked by policy: {result.reason}")
